#+TITLE: My .spacemacs.d/ setup

This is my =~/.spacemacs.d/= configuration: note that I am using the develop
branch of Spacemacs, so some things may not work as expected on the release
branch. I'm still getting to grips with Emacs and Spacemacs, so there are
probably many aspects that could be coded in a much more elegant way, or are
useful only to me!

However, I'm putting this in a public repo because a few people have expressed
an interest in seeing my config. It's probably more useful to view as an example
than to fork and use yourself as it is.
